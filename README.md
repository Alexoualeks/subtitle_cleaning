## README

Repo for extracting dialogue from srt files for data analyst or I used it for building Lingvist flash cards.

Use the NLP_text_cleaning_functions.R
This contains the function to convert srt into txt




Future next project stuff:
- Could I make it into a automatic converter? For example, put everyhting into a single file and it does everything

- Consider sentence when it ends with a full stop so not just a different line.

- Print out information on it's current process or the number of sentences
